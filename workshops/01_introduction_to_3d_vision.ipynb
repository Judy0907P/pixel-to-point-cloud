    "### Type hinting\n",
    "\n",
    "Type hinting is a way to specify the expected data types of function arguments and return values in Python. It helps improve code readability and maintainability by making the code more explicit and easier to understand. Take the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, it is not clear what the expected types of `a` and `b` are, or what the return type of the function is. In fact, the function will work with any type that supports the `+` operator, which can lead to unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if both `a` and `b` ints, the function will return an int:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a: int = 1\n",
    ">>> b: int = 2\n",
    ">>> result = add(a, b)\n",
    ">>> type(result)\n",
    "<class 'int'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we change `b` to a float, the function will return a float:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a: int = 1\n",
    ">>> b: float = 2.0\n",
    ">>> result = add(a, b)\n",
    ">>> type(result)\n",
    "<class 'float'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it hard for the user of the function to understand what input and output data to expect. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to use type hinting\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding type hints to the function, we can make it clear what the expected types are:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it is clear that the function expects two integers as input and will return an integer as output. This makes the code easier to understand and helps catch errors early on.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` {tip}\n",
    "In this repository typehinting is mandatory for all functions and classes, this is enforced by the use of `mypy` and `pyright` in the CI pipeline.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Numpy typing\n",
    "\n",
    "When using numpy arrays, the `nptyping` library can be used to specify the expected shape and data type of the arrays. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from nptyping import Float32, NDArray, Shape\n",
    "\n",
    "a: NDArray[Shape[\"3\"], Float32] = ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This specifies that `a` is a numpy array with shape `(3,)` and data type `float32`. The `Shape` can be used to specify a wide variety of shapes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Numbers**: `Shape[\"3, 4\"]` specifies a 3x4 matrix\n",
    "- **Labels**: `Shape[\"H, W\"]` specifies an image with height `H` and width `W`\n",
    "- **Wildcard**: \n",
    "  - `Shape[\"*\"]` specifies an one-dimensional array of any length.\n",
    "  - `Shape[\"*, 3\"]` specifies a two-dimensional array with 3 columns and any number of rows.\n",
    "- **Ellipsis**: \n",
    "  - `Shape[\"...\"]` specifies an array of any number of dimensions and any shape.\n",
    "  - `Shape[\"3, ...\"]` specifies an array with 3 elements in the first dimension and any number of elements in the remaining dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These can also be combined in various ways, for example `Shape[\"*, H, W, 3\"]` can be used to specify a batch of images with height `H`, width `W`, and 3 channels (rgb). See the full documentation [here](https://github.com/ramonhagenaars/nptyping/blob/master/USERDOCS.md#syntax-shape-expressions)."

    "\n",

    "The python files are executed as notebooks using the `jupytext` library, with the `py:percent` format.
